I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar in the Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management at North Carolina State University and a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Department of Epidemiology Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. I am based in Brooklyn, New York. 
I am also a member of the [Built Environment and Health Research Group](https://beh.columbia.edu/), and a fellow in the [Columbia Population Research Center](https://cprc.columbia.edu/).

I am an epidemiologist, and my research interests lay at the intersection of urban health, chronic disease prevention, and injury prevention. I have a strong research interest in the measurement of the built environment and in conducting large-scale, rigorous epidemiological studies to better understand how the built environment impacts physical activity and injury outcomes.
My research agenda is a guided by my belief that all communities should have access to safe opportunities for walking, bicycling, playing, and all other forms of physical activity. 

I hold a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Texas Health Science Center. I also received at Master of Science in Exercise Science and Bachelor of Science in Public Health from the University of Texas at Austin. 

I would love to chat with anyone about my work or or opportunities to collaborate. Feel free to email me directly.
