I am a Postdoc Fellow at Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University, New York. I am currently a T32 fellow in the program Advanced Training in Environmental Health and Data Science in the [Department of Environmental Health Sciences](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/environmental-health-sciences) at MSPH. I am also a member of the [Built Environment and Health Research Group](https://beh.columbia.edu/), and a fellow in the [Columbia Population Research Center](https://cprc.columbia.edu/).

I am an epidemiologist, and my research interests lay at the intersection of urban health, active transportation, and injury prevention. I have a strong research interest in the measurement of the built and social environment and conducting large-scale, rigorous epidemiological studies to better understand how the built environment impacts vulnerable road users.

I hold a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Texas Health Science Center. I also received at Master of Science in Exercise Science and Bachelor of Science in Public Health from the University of Texas at Austin. 

I would love to chat with anyone about my work or or opportunities to collaborate. Feel free to email me for inquiries.
